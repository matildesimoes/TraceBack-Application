# Elevator Pitch

Presenting our TraceBack app, the ideal answer for anyone who has ever misplaced or discovered something! Users of our app can quickly report lost things and look for items that have been found by others in their area. Our app matches lost and found items based on location and description, making it easier than ever to reunite lost items with their rightful owners. Also, reporting lost items, checking the status of reports, and interacting with other users are all made simple by our user-friendly design. Say goodbye to lost items and hello to our Lost and Found app!
