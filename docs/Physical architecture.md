## Physical architecture

In our app's physical architecture only 3 entities are featured: the Firebase server where the database with all the information required by the client, the Email server where the user logs in and the app itself, which the user interacts with.
The Firebase will include the Firestore Database, Authentication, Storage and Cloud Messaging.
